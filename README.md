# Netgear-Switch

## Objective 

>This project involved configuring a network with two distinct VLANs to improve network organization and security. VLAN 1 includes PC1, PC2, and an Ubuntu Server, while VLAN 2 consists of PC1, PC2, and two PS5 consoles. The router, connected to Port 8 on the switch, serves as the gateway for both VLANs, ensuring proper traffic management between them. Each device was assigned to its respective VLAN to ensure isolation and efficient network flow. The configuration allows for better traffic segmentation, security, and scalability within the network.

## Skills Learned

>VLAN Configuration: Configured and managed VLANs to organize and secure network traffic by isolating devices into appropriate groups.

>Network Segmentation: Gained experience in segmenting networks into logical groups, improving security and reducing unnecessary traffic.

>Switch Configuration: Configured managed switches, including assigning devices to specific VLANs and setting up trunk ports for multiple VLANs.

>Router Integration: Integrated the router with the switch for inter-VLAN routing, enabling communication between devices across different VLANs.

>Networking Protocols: Gained familiarity with VLAN tagging protocols (e.g., 802.1Q) and their role in transmitting traffic across multiple VLANs.

>Troubleshooting and Diagnostics: Improved troubleshooting skills, diagnosing and resolving issues related to VLAN configuration, IP addressing, and device connectivity.

>Network Security: Developed an understanding of network security practices, using VLANs to isolate devices and control traffic flow for enhanced protection.

>Scalability and Network Planning: Designed the network with scalability in mind, ensuring the ability to add more devices or VLANs in the future without compromising security or performance.
